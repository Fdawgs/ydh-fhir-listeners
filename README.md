## Deliverables

###  Care Connect RESTful FHIR API endpoints
Black Pear have built a web front-end (eSP) for a shared care record, which will retrieve data relating to a patient from each shareholder that have the capability to do so, and amalgamate it into this record. The record is not stored in a cache anywhere and is built on the fly.
Care providers can then access this record through a contextual link (an embedded link within the PAS).
Black Pear need to be able to make GET requests to a RESTful FHIR API endpoints to retrieve a set of six FHIR resources that adhere to their respective [Care Connect API profiles](https://nhsconnect.github.io/CareConnectAPI/) to populate the record.

###  Contextual Link
A contextual link needs to be added to our PAS to allow care providers access to the shared record. Refer to [Interoperability patterns - Contextual launch](https://github.com/Somerset-SIDeR-Programme/SIDeR-interop-patterns/wiki/contextual-launch) in the SIDeR wiki for more information.
